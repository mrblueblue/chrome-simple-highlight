#Chrome Simple Highlighter

Simple Highlighter is a Chrome extension that allows you to highlight text on a webpage. All your highlights are automatically saved, so when you return to the webpage, the highlights are still there!

Simple Highlighter works on most pages. The tool will not work on discontinguous text.

Choose from six colors: aqua, blue, green, yellow, pink, and red.
