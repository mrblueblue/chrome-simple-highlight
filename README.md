#Simple Highlighter
###Chrome Extension

Simple Highlighter allows you to highlight text on a webpage. All your highlights are automatically saved, so when you return to the webpage, your highlights are still there!

Simple Highlighter works on most pages. The tool will not work on discontinguous text.
